# BreadLog  
Logging framework developed by Team 5940 BREAD

BreadLog is a lightweight logging library designed for FRC teams. It provides a simple way to record robot states, sensor data, subsystem values, and poses during both real and simulation operations.

BreadLog was originally built for 5940, but is designed to be general enough for any team to integrate and modify.
